## 📖 Overview
**Branching Logic** is a developer-focused blog repository that dives deep into **software architecture**, **design patterns**, and modern development practices. Starting with the **MVC framework**, this repo serves as a resource for tutorials, examples, and insights for scalable and maintainable applications.

---

## 🌐 What is MVC?
The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** framework is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components:  
- **Model** – Handles data and business logic  
- **View** – Manages UI and presentation  
- **Controller** – Acts as an intermediary between Model and View  

Originally designed for desktop GUIs, MVC is now widely used in **web development** and **mobile apps** for creating scalable, testable projects.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
This project uses:
- **Express.js** – Web framework for Node.js  
- **Node.js & NPM** – JavaScript runtime and package manager  
- **Handlebars.js** – Templating engine for dynamic views  
- **PostgreSQL & SQLite** – Database options for persistence  
- **bcrypt** – Secure password hashing  
- **express-session** – Session management (stores session data in cookies)  
- **connect-session-sqlite** – SQLite-based session store for Express  

---

## ✨ Features
- MVC architecture for clean separation of concerns  
- Secure authentication with **bcrypt**  
- Session management using **express-session** and **connect-session-sqlite**  
- Dynamic views powered by **Handlebars.js**  
- PostgreSQL or SQLite for flexible data storage  

---

## 🧩 Components of MVC
### **Controller**
- Interprets user input  
- Updates Model  
- Selects and renders View  

### **View**
- Displays data from Controller  
- Handles UI rendering  

### **Model**
- Manages data and business rules  
- Handles CRUD operations
